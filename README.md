# Game-Solitaire

##What Is This?
This is a fully functional game of Klondike (Solitaire). 
In this version of the game, one card can be turned at a time in the top left waste pile.  There is no limit on passing through the waste pile. Organize all 52 cards by suite and in a accending order to the foundations in the top right corner to win the game.

Amazing things will happen when you win the game. o^__^o
